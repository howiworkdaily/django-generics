django-generic's purpose is to provide a repository of useful abstract base
classes (ABC's) and model template inheritence (MTI's).

If all of that goes over our head, read up on it in the django docs and also at
http://blog.howiworkdaily.com/post/2008/jun/17/django-tutorial-abstract-base-classes-vs-model-inh/ 

Suggested models include:

= DONE =

= NOT DONE =
* ContentBase
* Events
* Menus (Restaurant-type)
* Blog
* People
* Places


If you would like to see one here that isn't on the list, feel free to drop a
comment and we'll see what we can do.
